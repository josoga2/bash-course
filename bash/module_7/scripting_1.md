# Scripting
Bash scripts are sequences of commands executed by the Bash shell. They automate tasks and can be used to perform complex operations. Understanding Bash syntax is crucial for writing effective scripts.

## Basic Syntax
Here are some basic rules for using Bash in scripts:

- Comments: Comments start with a # and Bash ignores them.
- Command Order: Commands run one after the other, from top to bottom.
- Semicolons: Use ; to run multiple commands on the same line.

## Comments
> nano script_1.sh
```
# This script prints a greeting message
echo "Hello, World!"
```

## Command Execution Order
> nano script_1.sh
```
echo "First command"
echo "Second command"
```

# Semicolons
> nano script_1.sh
```
# A simple script
echo "This is a test"; echo "This is another test"
```
